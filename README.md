# Ethereumcpuminer
A CPU miner that mines ETH

A miner that is user friendly to mine Ethereum with your CPU.

But how? 
Of course you can't mine ETH with a CPU but we mine Monero (RandomX) and convert it on the pool to ETH.

How do I start?
Put in your ETH address (and optional threads) and click "Start Mining".

What is the fee? 
The miner itself takes 1% fee and the pool 0.75% so thats 1.75% fee.
